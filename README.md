If you do something cool with it, I'd love to hear about it!

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

This code is largely based on the sample app from the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial* book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book).
