      Imagine one of those
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xQ_vcGgwOU" target="_blank">coin-donation funnels</a>
      you sometimes see at museums. The coin rolls around in an ever-tightening spiral, until it finally ends up in the
      bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s an example of a
      <strong>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system" target="_blank">Dynamical systems</a>
      </strong>. In a dynamical system, some value evolves over time, and the value at any given time is based on
      previous values. In the coin funnel example, we could track the coordinates of the coin as it moves around the
      funnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the coin funnel, the coin ends up in the basin at the bottom, and it stops moving. If we graphed its position
      over time, the graph would get pretty boring at this point. This is an example of an
      <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor" target="_blank">"attractor"</a></strong>. The gravity
      and funnel shape "attract" the coin to the basin. Once there, the coin won’t move unless perturbed by something
      outside the system (like a museum employee coming to empty out all the money). In other words, the attractor is
      <strong>stable</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coin funnel is a pretty simple attractor. But some attractors are <strong>chaotic</strong>. Chaotic
      attractors, known as <strong>"strange attractors"</strong>, have these characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        They’re attractors, like the coin funnel. Different starting points will all tend to converge on whatever
        pattern is created by the attractor.
      </li>
      <li>
        They’re chaotic, unlike the coin funnel. If you take two starting points that are very near each other, and run
        them both through several generations of the equations that govern the strange attractor, the two points won’t
        stay near each other, though they will stay within the attractor.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The strange attractors are generated by picking a starting point, and plotting out where it goes as it’s run
      through the equation over and over again. Some equations don’t lead to strange attractors - many equations cause
      the point to quickly zoom off to infinity (not an attractor), or quickly settle into a periodic pattern (not
      chaotic). But some equations lead to beautiful patterns!
